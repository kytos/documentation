How to create your own NApp: Part 4
###################################

********
Overview
********

In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a Network Application (NApp) for
*Kytos* (|kytos|_) to communicate with your application. This NApp will be made
with a public and a private REST endpoints.

The average time to go through this is: ``20 min``.

What you will learn
===================

* How to create a superuser;
* How to create a NApp with a public and a private REST endpoint.

What you will need
==================

* How to create a basic NApp: Part 1 - Refer to |Tutorial_01|_;
* How to create a basic NApp: Part 2 - Refer to |Tutorial_02|_;
* How to create a basic NApp: Part 3 - Refer to |Tutorial_03|_;
* Your |dev_env|_ already up and running;
* The Storehouse NApp, installed and running.


************
Introduction
************

Besides events, another method to communicate with your NApp is
through REST endpoints. These endpoints can be public or private
(please note that the latter is still under development).

The creation of a new endpoint is made by the use of the `@rest` decorator,
and it can be optionally protected using the `@authenticated`
decorator. More information about this module can be found in
the |protect_rest|_ and in the |auth|_.


*************************
Creating your application
*************************

First, to create your application, you have to run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    (env) $ mkdir ~/tutorials
    (env) $ cd ~/tutorials
    (env) $ kytos napps create

Now, you must input some data about your NApp:

.. code-block:: console

    --------------------------------------------------------------
    Welcome to the bootstrap process of your NApp.
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    In order to answer both the username and the napp name,
    You must follow this naming rules:
    - name starts with a letter
    - name contains only letters, numbers or underscores
    - at least three characters
    --------------------------------------------------------------

    Please, insert your NApps Server username: <username>
    Please, insert your NApp name: authtest
    Please, insert a brief description for your NApp [optional]: authtest napp!

    Congratulations! Your NApp have been bootstrapped!
    Now you can go to the directory <username>/authtest and begin to code your NApp.
    Have fun!

After filling your data, you can access the base code of your application in main.py:

You can open the main.py file with any code editor of your preference. 

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd ~/tutorials
    $ <code-editor> <username>/authtest/main.py

You can use nano, vi, emacs, gedit, vscode, atom or another code editor, replace 
<code-editor> with the code editor. See the example using nano:

.. code-block:: console

    $ nano <username>/authtest/main.py


The base code will initially look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    """Main module of <username>/authtest Kytos Network Application.

    authtest NApp !
    """

    from kytos.core import KytosNApp, log

    from napps.<username>.authtest import settings


    class Main(KytosNApp):
        """Main class of <username>/authtest NApp.

        This class is the entry point for this NApp.
        """

        def setup(self):
            """Replace the '__init__' method for the KytosNApp subclass.

            The setup method is automatically called by the controller when your
            application is loaded.

            So, if you have any setup routine, insert it here.
            """
            pass

        def execute(self):
            """Run after the setup method execution.

            You can also use this method in loop mode if you add to the above setup
            method a line like the following example:

                self.execute_as_loop(30)  # 30-second interval.
            """
            pass

        def shutdown(self):
            """Run when your NApp is unloaded.

            If you have some cleanup procedure, insert it here.
            """
            pass
            
Then, edit the methods of Main class:

.. code-block:: python

    """Main module of <username>/authtest Kytos Network Application.

    authtest NApp !
    """

    from kytos.core import KytosNApp, log

    from napps.<username>.authtest import settings


    class Main(KytosNApp):
        """Main class of <username>/authtest NApp.

        This class is the entry point for this NApp.
        """

        def setup(self):
            """Replace the '__init__' method for the KytosNApp subclass.

            The setup method is automatically called by the controller when your
            application is loaded.

            So, if you have any setup routine, insert it here.
            """
            self.msg = "Working"

        def execute(self):
            """Run after the setup method execution.

            You can also use this method in loop mode if you add to the above setup
            method a line like the following example:

                self.execute_as_loop(30)  # 30-second interval.
            """
            log.info("Running authtest!")

        def shutdown(self):
            """Run when your NApp is unloaded.

            If you have some cleanup procedure, insert it here.
            """
            log.info("Bye!)

Now, import the REST decorator and create a REST endpoint:

- Importing rest(*line 1*), jsonify and request(*line 4*) :

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 4

    from kytos.core import KytosNApp, log, rest

    from napps.<username>.authtest import settings
    from flask import jsonify, request

- Creating the REST endpoint:

.. code-block:: python

    @rest("v1/")
    def get_data(self):
        """ Return a string."""
        return jsonify(self.msg), 200

Now, see two parts together:

.. code-block:: python

    from kytos.core import KytosNApp, log, rest

    from napps.<username>.authtest import settings
    from flask import jsonify, request


    class Main(KytosNApp):
        """Main class of <username>/authtest NApp.

        This class is the entry point for this NApp.
        """

        def setup(self):
            """Replace the '__init__' method for the KytosNApp subclass.

            The setup method is automatically called by the controller when your
            application is loaded.

            So, if you have any setup routine, insert it here.
            """
            self.msg = "Working"

        def execute(self):
            """Run after the setup method execution.

            You can also use this method in loop mode if you add to the above setup
            method a line like the following example:

                self.execute_as_loop(30)  # 30-second interval.
            """
            log.info("Running authtest!")

        def shutdown(self):
            """Run when your napp is unloaded.

            If you have some cleanup procedure, insert it here.
            """
            log.info("Bye!)
        
        @rest("v1/")
        def get_data(self):
            """ Return a string."""
            return jsonify(self.msg), 200

Run kytos:

.. code-block:: console

    (env) $ kytosd -f

Open another terminal and install your application:

.. code-block:: console

    (env) $ python3 setup.py develop

Check if your application is installed and running with the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ kytos napps list

    Status |          NApp ID          |              Description
    =======+===========================+=======================================
    [ie]  | kytos/storehouse          | ….
    [ie]  | kytos/authtest            | ….

Accessing the REST endpoint of your application in a browser or REST client,
you will receive a message with a return like this:

Endpoint:

.. code-block:: console

   GET /api/<username>/<napp_name>/v1/

Request:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8181/api/<username>/authtest/v1/

Response:

.. code-block:: console

    {"Working"}


Congrats!! You finished the first part this tutorial.

How to protect your endpoint
============================

Now, you can secure the created endpoint. To do this, you have to
import the `@authenticated` decorator and add it to this endpoint method.

- Importing *authenticated* decorator.

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 1

    from kytos.core import KytosNApp, log, rest, authenticated
    from napps.<username>.authtest import settings
    from flask import jsonify, request


- Protecting the REST endpoint:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    @rest('v1/')
    @authenticated
    def get_data(self):
        return jsonify(self.msg), 200

See, all together:

.. code-block:: python

    from kytos.core import KytosNApp, log, rest, authenticated
    from napps.<username>.authtest import settings
    from flask import jsonify, request

    class Main(KytosNApp):

        def setup(self):
            self.msg = "Working"

        def execute(self):
            log.info("Running authtest!")

        def shutdown(self):
            log.info("Bye!")
        
        @rest('v1/')
        @authenticated
        def get_data(self):
            return jsonify(self.msg), 200

Then, if you try to access this endpoint, you will receive an error message
requesting the authentication token. This token must be obtained in the
superuser login process.

Endpoint:

.. code-block:: console

    GET api/<username>/<napp_name>/v1/

Request:

.. code-block:: console

    GET http://127.0.0.1:8181/api/<username>/<napp_name>/v1/

Response:

.. code-block :: console

    {"error": "Token not send or expired."}


This error is expected, now to access this REST endpoint, you must send a token 
in the request. To obtain this token, you need to create a user and request 
a token.

How to create a Superuser
=========================

You will now learn how to create a superuser and request the required token 
to access your protected REST endpoint.

The protection of the public REST endpoints is accomplished by creating a user
in authentication module. In development environment, run the command below in a 
terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ kytosd -f -C

    -----------------------
    username: <your_name>
    email: <your_email>
    password: <your_pass>
    re-password: <your_pass>


If all goes well, Kytos will create the user and start normally.

Requesting the authentication token
===================================

Now that superuser has been created, you should access the login endpoint to
request the access token:

Endpoint:

.. code-block :: console

    GET api/kytos/core/auth/login/

Request:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -u username:password http://127.0.0.1:8181/api/kytos/core/auth/login/

You will receive the token:

.. code-block:: console

    {"token": <token>}

Now, you have to send the token in the `Bearer` HTTP header
to be able to access this endpoint:

.. note:: Replace the token field with token you received.

Endpoint:

.. code-block:: console

    GET /api/<username>/<napp_name>/v1/

Request Format:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8181/api/<username>/<napp_name>/<endpoint> \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Request:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:8181/api/<username>/authtest/v1/ \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

If no error occurs, you will receive the normal return from the endpoint:

Response:

.. code-block:: console

    {"Working"}

.. note:: If an error occurs, check the error message and request a new token if
          it has expired.

Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and explored the creation of REST
endpoints using different request methods like POST, PATCH and DELETE. One tip is
that you can use a REST client named |Postman|_ to test your application.
