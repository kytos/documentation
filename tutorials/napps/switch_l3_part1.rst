Creating a L3 learning switch - Part 1
######################################

********
Overview
********
This tutorial will show the first steps to create an L3 learning switch NApp
using *Kytos* (|kytos|_).
The average time to go through this is: ``25 min``

What you will learn
====================
* How to capture OpenFlow Packet-In events;
* How to unpack the Packet-In data looking for L3 information;
* How to install flows for a switch to perform packet switching.

What you will need
===================
* Your |dev_env|_ already up and running.
* The *kytos/of_core* NApp installed and enabled.

************
Introduction
************

Layer 3
=======
*Layer 3* refers to the *Network layer*, the third one in the |osi_model|_. This layer
is responsible for defining logical addresses and identification for network
devices.

The |ip_proto|_, used in the Internet for example, is the most relevant implementation
for this layer. IP addresses, like '192.168.10.1', are essentialy Layer 3 addresses.

The L3 learning switch
======================

The Layer 3 learning switch will operate similarly to the |l2ls|_,
but working with IP addresses instead of MAC addresses.

The *l3ls* NApp will learn at which port each IP address is, and install reactive
flows in switches to handle traffic based on source IP and destination IP.

Is this a router?
=================

No. A router should be capable of switching packets between different networks, and
to actively communicate with hosts using protocols such as ARP and ICMP. We will cover
the steps to implement routing in future tutorials.

For this implementation of *l3ls*, we will consider that hosts are in the same logical
network.

.. NOTE:: We are also considering the addresses to be IPv4 addresses and
    Mininet will handle the ARP tables for each host.

.. ATTENTION:: This NApp was designed for instructional purposes. Running it in
    production environments may lead to unwanted behavior.

******************
Creating your NApp
******************

First, create your NApp using the ``kytos`` command. Use 'tutorial' as the
username and 'of_l3ls' as the NApp name, as follows (don't forget to create
the ``~/tutorials`` folder if it does not exist):

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials
  $ kytos napps create
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome to the bootstrap process of your NApp.
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  In order to answer both the username and the napp name,
  You must follow this naming rules:
   - name starts with a letter
   - name contains only letters, numbers or underscores
   - at least three characters
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  Please, insert your NApps Server username: tutorial
  Please, insert your NApp name: of_l3ls
  Please, insert a brief description for your NApp [optional]: This NApp does packet switching using L3 information

  Congratulations! Your NApp have been bootstrapped!
  Now you can go to the directory tutorial/of_l3ls and begin to code your NApp.
  Have fun!

Open the ``main.py`` file in your preferred editor to start coding your NApp.


Create the switching table
==========================

First we will create an L3 switching table for each switch that connects to the
controller. The table is implemented as a Python dictionary. The method needs
a decorator in order to listen to the Kytos's *new switch* event.

.. code-block:: python

    @listen_to('kytos/core.switches.new')
    def create_switching_table(self, event):
        switch = event.content['switch']
        switch.l3_table = {}

.. ATTENTION:: Some classes and methods used in the code snippets need to be imported
    in your main.py file. Please check the full content of the file and import these
    elements as needed.


Update switching table with incoming packets
============================================

In this step, you will create a method to handle PacketIn events. A PacketIn is
generated everytime the switchs sends a packet to the controller for analysis.

The method has a decorator to listen to *packet in* events. It unpacks the
``packet_in.data`` into an Ethernet instance. If the frame data contains an IP
packet, we unpack it into an IPv4 instance.

Once you have the IPv4 header information, you can use it to update the
switching table, associating it with the *in_port* - the physical switch
interface where the packet came from.

You can also add a log message to know when the controller receives a packet.

.. code-block:: python

    @listen_to('kytos/of_core.v0x01.messages.in.ofpt_packet_in')
    def handle_packet_in(self, event):
        packet_in = event.content['message']

        ethernet = Ethernet()
        ethernet.unpack(packet_in.data.value)

        if ethernet.ether_type.value == 0x800:
            ipv4 = IPv4()
            ipv4.unpack(ethernet.data.value)

            in_port = packet_in.in_port.value
            switch = event.source.switch
            switch.l3_table[ipv4.source] = in_port
            log.info('Packet received from %s to %s.', ipv4.source,
                     ipv4.destination)


Create Flow Mods for IP Addresses
=================================

The next step is to check if the switch already knows from which port the destination
address is reachable. Your method will look for it in the l3 switching table.

If the switch does know where the packet shall go to, then you will install a Flow in it so
new packets with the same source and destination addresses will be directly and
correctly forwarded, without needing the controller.
The Flow will instruct the switch to handle those new packets himself.

Your Flow Mod message shall have:
 - A Flow Mod Command: as this is a new Flow, the command is OFPFC_ADD;
 - A Flow Match: A match has all information you want the switch to check before
   deciding if the packet belongs to this particular flow. You want the switch to match the
   source IP address, the destination IP address and the Ethernet Type (IP);
 - A list of Actions: All the actions to be performed on the incoming packet are
   executed by the switch. Given this is a switching NApp, you want the switch
   to send the packet through the correct port, defined by the controller.

Once you have prepared the Flow Mod, create a KytosEvent containing it directed to the switch
that sent you the PacketIn, and put this event in the ``msg_out`` buffer.

.. code-block:: python

            dest_port = switch.l3_table.get(ipv4.destination, None)

            if dest_port is not None:
                log.info('%s is at port %d.', ipv4.destination, dest_port)
                flow_mod = FlowMod()
                flow_mod.command = FlowModCommand.OFPFC_ADD
                flow_mod.match = Match()
                flow_mod.match.nw_src = ipv4.source
                flow_mod.match.nw_dst = ipv4.destination
                flow_mod.match.dl_type = ethernet.ether_type
                flow_mod.actions.append(ActionOutput(port=dest_port))
                event_out = KytosEvent(name=('tutorial/of_l3ls.messages.out.'
                                             'ofpt_flow_mod'),
                                       content={'destination': event.source,
                                                'message': flow_mod})
                self.controller.buffers.msg_out.put(event_out)
                log.info('Flow installed! Subsequent packets will be sent directly.')


Send the packet back to the network
===================================

Whether your switch found a destination or not, the flow installed on the previous
step will work only for new incoming packets. There is still need to handle this
particular packet that generated the PacketIn event.

Create a PacketOut with the content of the PacketIn (same buffer_id, in_port
and data). If the controller knows the packet destination, then you can send it
right away through the proper port. If the controller does not know it, then tell
the switch to *flood* the packet: send it to all ports except the in_port.

Once again, create a KytosEvent and put it in the ``msg_out`` buffer.

.. code-block:: python

            packet_out = PacketOut()
            packet_out.buffer_id = packet_in.buffer_id
            packet_out.in_port = packet_in.in_port
            packet_out.data = packet_in.data

            port = dest_port if dest_port is not None else Port.OFPP_FLOOD
            packet_out.actions.append(ActionOutput(port=port))
            event_out = KytosEvent(name=('tutorial/of_l3ls.messages.out.'
                                         'ofpt_packet_out'),
                                   content={'destination': event.source,
                                            'message': packet_out})

            self.controller.buffers.msg_out.put(event_out)


Final main.py file
==================

Now your ``main.py`` file shall look like the one below. Here we have all the
needed imports, and comments were removed to improve readability.

                                                    'message': flow_mod})
                    self.controller.buffers.msg_out.put(event_out)
                    log.info('Flow installed! Subsequent packets will be sent directly.')

                packet_out = PacketOut()
                packet_out.buffer_id = packet_in.buffer_id
                packet_out.in_port = packet_in.in_port

*****************************
Running and testing your NApp
*****************************

To run your NApp, you need to run *Kytos* first to enable NApp management. In
another terminal window, make sure to activate your |dev_env|_ and run:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytosd -f

  (...)

  kytos $>

As you can see, there is a log line indicating that *kytos/of_core* is running.
You need the OpenFlow core NApp installed and enabled. It is possible to check
it by running, in the previous terminal window:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ kytos napps list

  Status |          NApp ID          |                     Description

If the NApp is installed but not enabled, you can enable it by running:

.. code-block:: console

  $ kytos napps enable kytos/of_core

Now, install and run the *l3ls* NApp:

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ~/tutorials
  $ kytos napps install tutorial/of_l3ls
  INFO  NApp tutorial/of_l3ls:
  INFO    Searching local NApp...
  INFO    Found and installed.
  INFO    Enabling...
  INFO    Enabled.

With the NApp installed and enabled, we can run Mininet to see it in action:

.. code-block:: console

  $ sudo mn -c ; sudo mn --controller remote --arp --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow10

.. IMPORTANT:: As no specific topology configuration was passed to Mininet, it
    will generate a virtual network with a switch connecting two hosts, 10.0.0.1
    and 10.0.0.2. The ``--arp`` flag tells Mininet to populate the ARP tables, which
    is needed because we are only handling IP packets.

.. ATTENTION:: Just like the l2ls implementation, this NApp will NOT work in
    topologies containing loops. However, it works with linear and tree topologies.

Now, in the Mininet console, run:

.. code-block:: console

  mininet> h1 ping h2
  PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=83.3 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=66.6 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.495 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.117 ms
  64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=5 ttl=64 time=0.114 ms

The pings are sucessful! Communication between the hosts is possible because the
*of_l3ls* NApp has dealt with the Flows. You can check it by looking at the controller
logs:

.. code-block:: console

  2017-07-25 16:04:07,150 - INFO [tutorial/of_l3ls] (Thread-88) Packet received from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2.

  2017-07-25 16:04:08,163 - INFO [tutorial/of_l3ls] (Thread-94) Flow installed! Subsequent packets will be sent directly.

Once the flows are set in both directions, the switch sends the packets direclty.
Good job!
