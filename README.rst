Introduction
============
The kytos project was conceived to fill a gap that no other controller
available at the market has filled: a controller that could be compatible with
multiple OpenFlow versions and that was centered on the development of
applications by its users. Thus, our intention is not only to build a new
OpenFlow controller, but also build a community of developers around it,
creating new applications that benefit from the SDN paradigm. 

The project was born in 2014, when the first version of the message parsing
library was built. After some time stalled, the development took off earlier
2016, when a team of developers from the São Paulo State university  was
assembled with the mission of presenting a prototype of such controller at the
2016 Super Computing convention. 

In less than a year a new library was built, following a strict free open
source software philosophy in mind. Also, a new controller and a basic set of
network applications know as NApps was developed. During the SC'16, we were
able to orchestrate traffic of 100Gbps installing the flows needed to create
a circuit between sender and receiver machines.

Installing
==========

[Something like:
*Kytos is a multi component project.
Actually you don't install kytos.
You should install the main controller, Kytos Controller (kyco).
For more information, please visit the kyco documentation.*]
