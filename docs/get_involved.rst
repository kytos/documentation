Contributing guidelines
-----------------------

We'd love for you to contribute to our source code and to make Kytos even better
than it is today! Here are the guidelines we follow:

- `Got a Question or Problem?`_
- `Found an Issue?`_
- `Want a Feature?`_
- `Want a Doc Fix?`_
- `Submission Guidelines`_
- `Coding Style`_
- `Tests`_
- `Signing the CLA`_

Got a Question or Problem?
--------------------------

If you have questions about how to use any component of Kytos project, please
direct these to our dev mailing list. We are also available on IRC. Check the
details in the :ref:`kytos-get-help` section.

.. _contributing-issue:

Found an Issue?
---------------

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can
help us by submitting an issue to our `GitHub Repository <https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow/issues>`__. Even better,
you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

**Please see the** `Submission Guidelines`_ **below.**

.. _contributing-feature-request:

Want a Feature?
---------------

You can also request a new feature by submitting an issue to our `GitHub
Repository <https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow/issues>`__.
If you would like to implement a new feature, then consider what kind of change
it is:

- **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be
  discussed first in our dev mailing list or IRC (see: :ref:`kytos-get-help`
  section), so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication
  of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted
  into the project.

- **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted to the `GitHub Repository
  <github.com/kytos/python-openflow>`__ as a Pull Request.

.. _contributing-doc-fix:

Want a Doc Fix?
---------------

Updating Sphinx documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the documentation that is created by Sphinx, in the `docs` folder,
follow these instructions:

1. In Python files, use
   `Google-style docstrings <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>`_
   (`Napoleon docs <http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html>`_
   is also a useful resource);
2. To generate the documentation, run `make` inside `docs` folder;
3. Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in your browser to check the output of
   your changes;
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you are satisfied with the results (don't forget
   to refresh the page in the browser);

Tips and tricks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To automatically build the documentation and refresh the browser every time a
file is changed:

1. Install the required package: `sudo pip3 install sphinx-autobuild`
2. In the `docs` folder, run `make livehtml`
3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html

Check before submitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before submitting a doc fix, please, see the section `Checking your code`_.

Submission Guidelines
---------------------

Submitting an Issue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you submit your issue, search the archive to check if the issue is
already there with an answer.

When opening a new issue, please, use the proper tags we provide to identify
the version of the release you are using and the type of the issue that is being
opened (i.e.: discussion, bugs, etc). It is important to note that these issues
will be used as release's cutoff.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend both fixing issues and adding new
features by not reporting duplicate issues. The more relevant information you
provide, the faster contributors can tackle the issue. Here are some useful
information you might be able to provide:

-  **Check existing issues** for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for
   both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re
   running into has been already addressed;
-  **Be clear** about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what
   happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem;
-  **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain why this is a bug for you;
-  **Include system details** like what library or operating system you’re
   using and their versions;
-  **Paste error output** or logs in your issue or in a `Gist <http://gist.github.com/>`__. When
   pasting them in the issue, wrap it with three backticks: **\`\`\`** so that it
   renders nicely, like ``this``;
-  **Use Tags** Please, remember to tag your issue according to the version and
   the issue type;
-  **Steps to reproduce** - please inform all the steps to reproduce the error;
-  **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
-  **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point
   to what might be causing the problem (line of code or commit).

For more information about github issues, please read `github's Issues
guide <https://guides.github.com/features/issues/>`__.

Submitting a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you’re able to patch the bug or add the feature yourself – fantastic, make a
pull request with the code! Be sure you’ve read the documents on contributing,
understand the license and have signed our `Contributor License Agreement
(CLA) <Signing the CLA_>`_. Once you’ve submitted a pull request, the maintainer(s) can
easily compare your branch to the existing one and decide whether or not to
incorporate (pull in) your changes.

All Kytos subproject uses uses the `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ and we follow
the `Gitflow Workflow <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>`_. All contributors should create a fork from
``develop`` branch with the feature's name. Once the feature is implemented the
contributor should place a pull request to the ``develop`` branch.

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

-  Search `GitHub <https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow/pulls>`__ for an open or
   closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to
   duplicate effort;
-  Please sign our `CLA <Signing the CLA_>`_ before sending pull requests. We cannot accept
   code without this;
-  Make your changes in a new git branch, from ``develop`` branch:

   .. code:: shell

       git checkout -b my-fix-branch develop

-  **Include appropriate test cases**;
-  Follow our `Coding Style`_;
-  Commit your changes using very good and descriptive commit messages;
-  Please consider doing atomic commits (small changes in each commit).
-  Run our test suit to check if anything is broken:

   .. code:: shell

       python3 setup.py test

-  Push your branch to GitHub:

   .. code:: shell

       git push origin my-fix-branch

-  In GitHub, send a pull request to ``python-openflow:develop``.
-  If we suggest changes then:
-  Make the required updates.
-  Re-run the test suite to ensure tests are still passing.
-  Commit your changes to your branch (e.g. ``my-fix-branch``).
-  Push the changes to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull
   Request).

If the PR gets too outdated we may ask you to rebase and force push to update
the PR:

.. code:: shell

    git pull
    git rebase develop -i
    git push origin my-fix-branch -f

*WARNING. Squashing or reverting commits and forced push thereafter may remove
GitHub comments on code that were previously made by you and others in your
commits.*

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

Hot Fix and Security Fix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To solve important problems like security issues or bugs, we follow a slightly
different workflow to make sure the changes can be merged also in the master
branch (production code). The contributer should clone the master branch and,
after fixing the bug, it has to be merged in both master and develop branch.

First clone the master branch as following:

.. code:: bash

    git checkout -b issue-#001 master
    # Fix the bug
    git checkout master
    git merge issue-#001
    git push

Then, merge the fix to develop branch as well:

.. code:: shell

    git checkout develop
    git merge issue-#001
    git push

After your pull request is merged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull
the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

-  Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your
   local shell as follows:

   .. code:: shell

       git push origin --delete my-fix-branch

-  Check out the ``develop`` branch:

   .. code:: shell

       git checkout develop -f

-  Delete the local branch:

   .. code:: shell

       git branch -D my-fix-branch

-  If you haven't done it yet, add the ``upstream`` repository (only once):

   .. code:: shell

       git remote add upstream https://github.com/kytos/python-openflow.git
       git remote # you should now see origin and upstream

-  Update your ``develop`` with the latest upstream version:

   .. code:: shell

       git pull upstream develop

Information about environment setup for developers can be found in the
``hacking`` section of each project.

Pull Request Pro Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Fork <http://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`__ the repository
   and clone it locally. Connect your local repository to the original
   ‘upstream’ one by adding it as a remote. **Pull in** changes from ‘upstream’
   often to stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge
   conflicts will be less likely. See more detailed instructions
   `here <https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork>`__.
-  **Create** a `branch <http://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>`__ for
   your edits.
-  **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate
   that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about
   the steps you took to make your changes.
-  **It’s best to test**. Run your changes against any existing tests if they
   exist and create new ones when needed, trying to cover all your code.
   Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing
   project.
-  **Contribute using the project style** to the best of your abilities.
   This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you
   would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to
   merge, others to understand and maintain it in the future.

Open Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you’ve opened a pull request, a discussion will start around your proposed
changes. Other contributors and users may chime in, but ultimately the decision
is made by the maintainer(s). You may be asked to make some changes to your pull
request. If so, add more commits to your branch and push them – they’ll
automatically go into the existing pull request.

If your pull request is merged – great! If it is not, no sweat, it may not be
what the project maintainer had in mind, or they were already working on it.
This happens, so our recommendation is to take any feedback you’ve received and
go forth and pull request again – or create your own open source project
starting with the forked repository.

Code contribution steps review:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Fork the project & clone locally
-  Create an upstream remote and sync your local copy before you branch
-  Branch for each separate piece of work
-  Do the work, write good commit messages, and follow the project coding style
-  Push to your origin repository
-  Create a new PR in GitHub
-  Respond to any code review feedback

Coding style
------------

Code
~~~~

We follow `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_,
`PEP20 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_ and, as a short resume,
`The Best of the Best Practices (BOBP) Guide for Python <https://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839>`_.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For documentation, we follow pydocstyle (PEP257) and use Google-style
docstrings. More information about Google-style docstrings can be found in
the `Updating Sphinx documentation`_ section.


Checking your code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide a setuptools command to check the style and also look for bugs in
the code. Make sure you don't add errors to the output of (in root folder):

.. code:: shell

    python3 setup.py lint

During development, you may prefer the faster version below. If you do, run the
command above at least in the end, before submitting your contribution, to
check for additional problems.

.. code:: shell

    python3 setup.py quick_lint

Tests
-----

This project tries to follow the TDD (Test Driven Development) process. Before
writing code to contribute, write the tests related to the functionality you
wish to implement and then write the code to pass this test.

More info about the tests can be found in the ``hacking`` section of each
project.

Use the raw packet files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We provide some files with raw packets to be used as input with the parser
library. Use theses files to test your features. To use our raw packet files,
please take a look inside ``raw`` directory.

Signing the CLA
---------------

Please `sign <http://kytos.io/cla/>`__ our Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
before sending pull requests. For any code changes to be accepted, the CLA
must be signed. It's a quick process, we promise!
